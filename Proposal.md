## About Project

Project Name : The Deck Penetration Testing and Forensics Platform      

## Description 

## Testing the Available Tools in The Deck Linux

The Deck is a full-featured penetration testing and forensics system based on the [BeagleBoard-XM](https://beagleboard.org/beagleboard-xm). It will also run on the [BeagleBone BlackWireless](https://beagleboard.org/black-wireless).The Deck is an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution. It is suitable for everyone who is working on this platform because it consumes very little power and also runs on solar energy .This  Linux distribution has a full set of tools that run on the BeagleBoard-XM and the BeagleBone BlackWireless and allows flexibility. IT also supports a portable penetration testing platform like dropbox.

The Deck Linux is devoloped in 2015 by [Dr.Philip Polstra](https://github.com/ppolstra).He is a professor of Digital Forensics at Bloomsburg University. He is also the author of a number of books including "Hacking and Penetration Testing with Low Power Devices". He has made repeat appearances at DEFCON, BlackHat, B-sides, 44CON, GrrCON, and spoken at many top conferences all around the world, usually on hardware hacking or forensics. But the Deck linux is only compatible with the BeagleBone-XM and BeagleBone Black.When compared to the other Beagles it is little bit larger than other. 


In the first step I will install the current version of the Deck Linux in the BeagleBone Black Wireless, so that after installing I will come to the point of what are the tools in the Deck Linux and the tools to be added to the latest version.


## Making it comaptible for BeagleBone AI

My project is about to make the Deck linux Compatible with the latest [BeagleBone AI](https://beagleboard.org/ai). The main reason why I choose the AI board is because
the AI board comes with the 


* 1GB of RAM
* 16GB of on-board high speed eMMc Flash Storage
* It has Dual Arm速 Cortex速-A15 microprocessor subsystem
* 2x dual Arm速 Cortex速-M4 co-processors
* USB type-C for power and superspeed dual-role controller; and USB type-A host
* Gigabit Ethernet, 2.4/5GHz WiFi, and Bluetooth
* BeagleBone Black mechanical and header compatibility

In this project I am trying to take the Ethical Hacking to the next level by using the Artificial Inteligence.For example we have to select a victim that we are going to attack.Then by using the AI and OpenCv. Then we fix a 







## Softwares Required to Compile and Build the Kernel

Basically the C programing is required for building the kernel. Ubuntu Distribution is used as a basic Operating System for Building Kernel. The GCC is used to compile the C files(.c*). GNU Make is for building the kernel. Binutils is used for compiling the GNU Binary files of linux. And some of the libraries are used for other compiling processes.
