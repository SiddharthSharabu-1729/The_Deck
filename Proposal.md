## About Project

Project Name : The Deck Penetration Testing and Forensics Platform      

## Description 

## About The Deck Linux

The Deck is a full-featured penetration testing and forensics system based on the [BeagleBoard-XM](https://beagleboard.org/beagleboard-xm). It will also run on the [BeagleBone BlackWireless](https://beagleboard.org/black-wireless).The Deck is an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution. It is suitable for everyone who is working on this platform because it consumes very little power and also runs on solar energy .This  Linux distribution has a full set of tools that run on the BeagleBoard-XM and the BeagleBone BlackWireless and allows flexibility. It also supports a portable penetration testing platform like dropbox.

The Deck Linux is devoloped in 2015 by [Dr.Philip Polstra](https://github.com/ppolstra).He is a professor of Digital Forensics at Bloomsburg University. He is also the author of several books including "Hacking and Penetration Testing with Low Power Devices". He has made repeat appearances at DEFCON, BlackHat, B-sides, 44CON, GrrCON, and spoken at many top conferences all around the world, usually on hardware hacking or forensics. But the Deck Linux is only compatible with the BeagleBone-XM and BeagleBone Black. When we compare it with the other Beagles it is slightly larger. It is difficult to fix BeagleBone XM on top of the Drone to attack the victim at a higher altitude and it is not suitable for wireless attacks because it doesn't have the on-board Wi-Fi and Bluetooth module. when we compared the BeagleBone AI with the BeagleBone XM it has more advantages. BeagleBone AI has very powerful Processors and many other features which are mentioned below. 

## Testing the Deck Linux using BeagleBone Black Wireless

After the arrival of the hardware requres for this project, Firstly I would like to test the current version of the Deck Linux in the BeagleBone Black wireless. So that we can test the Linux for vulnerabilities and rectify them. so that we can get an idea about the tools in the Deck linux. Listing of tools is also the main thing in building the latest version of Linux. The combination of the old tools and latest tools are also added into the latest version of the Deck Linux.

## Additional Feautures to be added

The latest updated tools such as Metasploit, Maltego, Netsparker, Wireshark, Burpsuite, John The Ripper and other tons of latest tools is to be installed the latest build of the Deck Linux.

In this current version, The Deck doesn't support the on-board Wi-Fi Monitoring Mode. But in the latest build deck will support the On-Board Wi-Fi Monitoring Mode and a good processor, which can perform the Bruteforcing attacks in a fast and efficient manner.

## Making it comaptible for BeagleBone AI

My project is about to make the Deck linux Compatible with the latest [BeagleBone AI](https://beagleboard.org/ai). The main reason why I choose the AI board is because
the AI board comes with 


* 1GB of RAM
* 16GB of on-board high speed eMMc Flash Storage
* It has Dual Arm® Cortex®-A15 microprocessor subsystem
* 2x dual Arm® Cortex®-M4 co-processors
* USB type-C for power and superspeed dual-role controller; and USB type-A host
* Gigabit Ethernet, 2.4/5GHz WiFi, and Bluetooth
* BeagleBone Black mechanical and header compatibility


BeagleBone® AI fills the gap between small SBCs and more powerful industrial computers. Based on the Texas Instruments AM5729, developers have access to the powerful SoC with the ease of BeagleBone Black header and mechanical compatibility. BeagleBone AI makes it easy to explore how artificial intelligence (AI) can be used in everyday life via the TI C66x digital-signal-processor (DSP) cores and embedded-vision-engine (EVE) cores supported through an optimized TIDL machine learning OpenCL API with pre-installed tools. Focused on everyday automation in industrial, commercial and home applications.

It is a great combination of Ethical Hacking with Artificial Intelligence. For example, If we want to attack a particular person in a crowded area it is very difficult for us. So by using fully loaded tools with AI Integration Deck will make the work easier and better. Deck uses the OpenCv library to identify the person and it will attack the person automatically

## Softwares Required to Compile and Build the Kernel

Basically the C programing is required for building the kernel. Ubuntu Distribution is used as a basic Operating System for Building Kernel. The GCC is used to compile the C files(.c*). GNU Make is for building the kernel. Binutils is used for compiling the GNU Binary files of linux. And some of the libraries are used for other compiling processes.
