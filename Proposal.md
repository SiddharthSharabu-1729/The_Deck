## About My Project

Project Name : The Deck Penetration Testing and Forensics Platform      

## Description 

## Testing the Available Tools in The Deck Linux

The Deck is a full featured penetration testing and forensics system based on the [BeagleBoard-xM](https://beagleboard.org/beagleboard-xm).
It will also run on the [BeagleBone BlackWireless](https://beagleboard.org/black-wireless). The Deck is an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution. 
It contains everyone you would ever need and more in a small package. Because the system is low power it can be run for days or weeks from battery power. 
It should be possible to run The Deck indefinitely from solar power. Having a full set of tools that run on the BeagleBoard-xM and also the BeagleBone BlackWireless allows a lot of flexibility.
The Deck is equally suited as a portable penetration testing platform and as a drop box.


My project is about to make the Deck linux Compatible with the latest [BeagleBone AI](https://beagleboard.org/ai). The main reason why I choose the AI board is because
the AI board comes with the 


* 1GB of RAM
* 16GB of on-board high speed eMMc Flash Storage
* It has Dual Arm速 Cortex速-A15 microprocessor subsystem
* 2x dual Arm速 Cortex速-M4 co-processors
* USB type-C for power and superspeed dual-role controller; and USB type-A host
* Gigabit Ethernet, 2.4/5GHz WiFi, and Bluetooth
* BeagleBone Black mechanical and header compatibility
